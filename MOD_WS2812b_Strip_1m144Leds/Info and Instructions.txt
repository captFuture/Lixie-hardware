I like the Lixie Project verya much but I found that
the Digits are pretty small and 1,5mm Acrylic is hard
to get.

My first modification was to double the size in order
to be able to use 3mm Acrylic.

When my single LEDs arrived and I tried to testsolder them
I found it very painful and so I decided to go a different
way of creating.

I purchased a Ws2812b strip off Amazon with 144Leds per Meter
and after some measurements and scaling I ended up with
digits being .... small.

In the Mod Folder there is a file lixie_cut_strip.ai where
everything is divided into layers for scaling and creating

Everything is prepared for Laser Cutting black lines and
engraving red lines on a Trotec laser

I used Plywood 4mm and clear Acrylic 3mm
The modification does not use any type of pcb and the connection
of the Digits is completely up to you.
The only thing to keep in mind is the ordering of the individual led strips
(as shown in the engraving pattern of the led base)
